> [!CAUTION]  
> **This project is still in a very early development phase (pre-alpha).** Until we do a first release, there will be **no downloads available**.
> The current version **crashes frequently** and lacks many usability features for non-developer users.
> 
> If you are a Tinke user, be aware this project is not a replacement yet. It has a long way to go until it has the same feature set.
> 
> For now, this application is **only useful if you are a .NET/C# developer**, you are already familiar with [Yarhl](https://github.com/sceneGate/yarhl) and you want to test your converters.
> The best way to get the latest dev version of the app, it's to [build it locally](#Build). **Creating a fork and running the CI may not work.**

**Work-in-progress** tool for reverse engineering, file format analysis, modding
and localization.
